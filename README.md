## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

I was inspired by STAR-Zero „Åï„Çì's [LoveLive collection showcase](https://github.com/STAR-ZERO/LoveLive). I previously documented my collection of official LOONA merchandise on Amino, but the app was getting spammy so I uninstalled it.

By hosting it on a website via GitHub Pages, I get more control and flexibility over the display of the content through HTML and CSS.

## What?

This is a repository which shows the status of one's LOONA collection.

Releases coming soon.

## How?

This is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), with the [Material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme.</p>

### Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Python](https://www.python.org/), [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/)

#### Installing MkDocs and the Material theme

- Install the `mkdocs` package using pip:

```sh
pip install mkdocs
```

- Install the latest version of Material with pip:

```sh
pip install mkdocs-material
```

#### Retrieving the base files

- Download the base files under [Releases](https://github.com/flamanta/orbit-collection/releases), and extract all the files from the archive.

- Using the command line, navigate to the path where the extracted files are.

#### Editing the contents

- Start the preview server:

```sh
$ mkdocs serve
INFO    -  Building documentation...
INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
[I 160402 15:50:43 server:271] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000
[I 160402 15:50:43 handlers:58] Start watching changes
[I 160402 15:50:43 handlers:60] Start detecting changes
```

- Open up `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser, and you will see a preview of the site.

- Edit away!

  - The server supports auto-reloading. It rebuilds the site upon changes of the file content.

#### Publishing the contents

- When you're done editing the content, you can build the site contents.

```sh
mkdocs build
```

- Upload the contents of `site` onto your static site host.
